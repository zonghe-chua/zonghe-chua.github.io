## Selected Projects

**Opt. Haptic Training Pol. for the Learning of a Motor Task using Deep Q-Learning**, 2019<br>
_AA228: Decision Making Under Uncertainty_<br>
Modeled the learning of a trajectory following task under diﬀerent haptic training paradigms. Used deep rein-
forcement learning to solve for an optimal haptic training policy and compared it to a hand-designed policy.

**Robot End-Eﬀector Pose Estimation From Endoscopic Video for Skill Estimation**, 2019<br>
_CS231N: Convolutional Neural Networks for Visual Recognition_<br>
Implemented a convolutional neural net for visually estimating surgical robot end eﬀector pose and compared its
performance to that of a temporal convolutional net. Used the model to perform surgical skill classiﬁcation.

**Needle Alignment Robot for Assisted Cannulation in Home Dialysis**, 2019<br>
_ME328: Medical Robotics_<br>
Conceptualized a device to provide haptic guidance during self-cannulation in home dialysis. Conducted prelim-
inary experiments in support of a mock project proposal report.

**Bayesian Filtering for Online Error Detection in Surgical Robotic Maneuvers**, 2018<br>
_AA273: State Estimation and Filtering for Aerospace Systems_<br>
Implemented a multi-hypothesis Kalman ﬁlter to segment a surgical task into sub-tasks using robot state infor-
mation. Compared the ﬁlter’s performance to that of a Hidden Markov Model.

**Wearable Skin Stretch Haptic Device for Singing Pitch Correction**, 2018<br>
_ME327: Design and Control of Haptic Systems_<br>
Designed a wrist-worn skin stretch haptic device to provide real-time pitch feedback during singing.
