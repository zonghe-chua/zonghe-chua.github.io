## About Me

I am a graduate research assistant working in the Collaborative Haptics And Robotics in Medicine (CHARM) Lab under the supervision of Dr. Allison Okamura. 


My research focuses on exploring how haptics and other forms of sensory feedback can be used to enhance people's ability to teleoperate robotic systems - in particular, minimally-invasive surgical robotic platforms such as the daVinci Surgical System by Intuitive Surgical.


Prior to embarking on my graduate training, I was a mechanical designer at Yaskawa Electric America. There, I worked on the electromechanical design of high-power industrial electronics.
